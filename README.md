# YubiMe
Yubi-like key generation at your fingertips. **(Note: Serves no actual security purpose.)**

## Features
If you've ever worked at an organization with a 2-Factor Authentication hardware token, such as YubiKey, you may have discovered the joy of at first accidentally and perhaps later intentionally Yubi'ing your colleagues.

After leaving industry, you might feel hollow without this capability. YubiMe is intended to fill this void, providing you with all your Yubi'ing needs, because sometimes you just need to hit 'em with the Yubi.

Works on:
- OSX (tested)

## Usage
Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/peterxu30/yubi-me.git
```

Install the keyboard library (link)[https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard]
```
pip install keyboard
```

Make yubi_me.py executable
```
chmod +x yubi_me.py
```

Run as administrator
```
sudo ./yubi_me.py
```

To hit 'em with the Yubi
```
command + \
```

## Examples

## Author's Note
Yes, I know this is dumb. But like all good engineers, I asked "Can I?" before asking "Should I?"

I may work on this more, we'll see how I feel.

Stay classy folks,
